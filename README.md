# RFC Links

Select text containing "RFC" + 1-4 numbers, and get a context menu to the
[IETF](http://ietf.org/)'s HTML version of the RFC.

Neat, huh?!

My personal favorites (right now) are RFC2068 (HTTP/1.1 "beta"), RFC2616 (the
out of date HTTP spec), RFC 7231 (one of the 6 RFC2616 "upgrades"), and RFC3986
(the URI spec).

WHY U NO LINK THOZ?! :trollface:

'cause this is a test case. :smile_cat:
